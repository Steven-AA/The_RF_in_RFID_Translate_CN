\section{RFID System and Terminology}

We have alluded to key aspects of RFID systems in our discussion of the history of the technology in sections above. RFID systems are crucially distinguished by the frequency of the radio waves the employ, by the means used to provide power to the tags, and by the protocols employed to communicate between tag and reader. The choice of frequency, power source, and protocol has important implications for range, cost, and features available to the user.
